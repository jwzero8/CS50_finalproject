#### Description:

Why "wish"?
My project is called "Wish". It is my belief that a good creation, like a program or a website, is what can fulfill humans' needs. Wishes or visions, is an ambiguous concept that everyone should have. I make a website (with my skills learnt in CS50, Reddit, W3School and Stackoverflow, etc.) for people to write down their dreams, to track their own progress. I set wishes are not deletable but only allow updates for them. Reasoning behind it is simple. It does not matter of whether we can make it or not, what matters most is how much effort you have put into it. So leave your own records and marks for your own life. It is kind of like a part of your life diary. And I believe, you will be proud of yourself if you use "Wish" to write down your dreams and to discover the others' dreams. And you can leave comments in the discussion section. If you want, you can leave you contacts to see if anyone or the post owner will contact you to share more about his/her wish(es). Sharing and learning are always decent practice IMO. And one of the potential purposes of this application is to allow people to date with others. In COVID times, dating seems to be extremely hard for people to do. You can just stay in home and have no options to hang out with others. So through this website, if possible, you can just try to leave your contact to see who reply to you. But I do not want this to be the only purpose of "Wish". So users' sexes are not revealed. Anyway, just try it and find some buddies or crush-to-be. Good luck. Note: Sorry that these lines are just BS to fit the minimum word requirement of CS50. But I have to say that one of the purposes of setting up dicussion board is this.

Comments and Features:
Long story short, I make reference of the Bootstrap and one of the CS50's project for Login and register website. IMO, these are not that important and will be time-consuming if I just allocate my time on them as most likely what I do will be more or less the same as these functions. For aesthetics, admittedly, there is room for improvement. I will learn more of it when I start the next course-- CS50Web.

So features are as follows:

-- Login
-- Register
-- Wish, which shows your own list of wishes with date and status (fulfilled or not) included, you can update the status with the button at the bottom
-- Update, update the progress of your wishes, every wish is assigned a Wish_ID so you won't mix up with others, you cannot maliciously enter a Wish_ID that is not in your wish list.
-- Discover: You will see a wish of a random user.
-- Comment: Leave your message towards the post you see. Your comments will be divided into three parts, namely, "title", "content", "contact". Leave your contact if you want (maybe a chance to date with someone impressing you by their dreams LOL).
